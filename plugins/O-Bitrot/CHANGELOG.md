# Changelog — O-Bitrot

All notable changes to O-Bitrot are documented here.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-16

### Changed
- **PACKET_LOSS now spans clean → true total failure.** Root cause of the
  old ceiling: the Gilbert–Elliott mapping capped stationary Bad occupancy
  at `piB = loss01·0.6` and hard-coded loss probabilities 0.5 (Bad) /
  0.01 (Good), so full knob delivered only ~30% actual loss — and the
  unscaled 1% Good-state floor dropped one packet every ~2 s even at
  PACKET_LOSS = 0 while merely enabled. New mapping: `piB = 0.95·loss01`,
  Bad loss `0.5 + 0.5·loss01`, Good loss `0.01·loss01` plus a top-quartile
  ramp to 0.90 at full knob (the Markov clamp caps Bad occupancy at ~0.89
  even at BURST 100, so near total failure the Good state must drop
  packets too). Measured: 0 lost packets at knob zero; 98.6% at full knob
  (was ~30%). Knob feel changes across the range; the determinism
  convention (exactly 2 packet-stream draws per packet) is untouched.
- **Decay concealment now mutes out like real PLC.** Was −3 dB per
  repetition with no floor (never silent, imprinting a 50 Hz packet buzz
  indefinitely). Now −6 dB per repetition as a per-sample gain ramp,
  hard-flooring to exact silence by the end of the 3rd repetition
  (~60 ms). Decay repeats are also pitch-aligned via the existing AMDF
  path (previously Substitute-only) when the last good packet is
  periodic, with the same auto-degrade to packet-aligned replay when not.
- **Substitute cycle joints are OLA-spliced.** Cyclic replay previously
  wrapped with a bare index reset, landing the −1 dB step exactly at the
  wrap. Each joint now gets a ~1 ms raised-cosine tail→head crossfade
  (capped at period/3) with the gain step inside the fade; the resume
  index skips the pre-blended head samples so the period is preserved.
- **Presets re-tuned for the honest loss range:** Dropped Call
  PACKET_LOSS 45 → 65 (~51% true loss — the call actually drops);
  Total Media Failure 55 → 90 (~86% true loss, up from the ~17% the old
  mapping delivered).

### Testing
- Probe O (GE statistics) bounds re-derived for the new mapping
  (lostFrac 0.268, r̂ 0.472 at LOSS 40 / BURST 30) — measured 0.263 /
  0.469. Three new probes, 50/50 green: O2 knob-zero clean (0 lost of
  1474 packets at PACKET_LOSS 0), O3 full-knob true failure (lostFrac
  0.986), P2 decay mute-out (113 masked runs ≥ 5 lost packets: rep 1
  audible, reps 4+ exactly silent). All QUAL-02 block-size/ragged
  bit-identity and determinism probes unchanged and green.

### Added
- **Mono compatibility** — the plugin now loads on mono→mono and
  mono→stereo bus layouts in addition to stereo→stereo. Root cause of the
  previous behavior: the layout was hard-locked stereo in three places
  (bus constructor, `isBusesLayoutSupported`, and a `< 2`-channel
  early-return in `processBlock` that passed audio through untouched).
  Mono input is captured dual-mono into the ring; mono output takes the
  left engine channel; mono→stereo duplicates the input and runs the
  stereo path unchanged. Stereo→mono remains rejected (no downmix rule).

### Changed
- Nothing in the stereo path — verified bit-identical (all 44 pre-existing
  harness probes unchanged and green).

### Testing
- Three new harness probes (47/47 green): M1 mono→mono delay-compensated
  bit-exact null; M2 mono ch0 bit-identical to a dual-mono stereo render
  under maximum degradation (all families forced, GSM codec, crush with
  jitter/dither — proves RNG stream alignment between layouts); M3
  mono→stereo null on both output channels with junk-filled ch1 input the
  processor must discard.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-16

Initial release.

### Added
- **Six degradation families** over a shared capture-ring engine — Tape
  (wow, drag, full stops), CD Skip (buffer loops, restart chirps), Vinyl
  (revolution jumps, pops, locked grooves), Packet Loss (Gilbert–Elliott
  bursty loss with four concealment modes), Codec (Mu-law / GSM 06.10),
  and Crush (fractional bit quantize + sample-rate reduce with jitter,
  envelope depth, and TPDF dither).
- **Shared-buffer stochastic engine** — one media clock arbitrates Tape /
  CD / Vinyl events per tick; Packet, Codec, and Crush run as serial
  post-stages.
- **Seeded determinism** — a 0–9999 SEED parameter drives all 8 RNG
  streams; identical seed + input renders bit-identical output. Dice
  button rerolls from the UI.
- **Sync / free clocking** — tempo-synced divisions (1/16 – 1 bar) or free
  rate (0.1 – 20 Hz); HARD EDGES toggles splice crossfades off.
- **WebView UI** (900 × 620, Ouaricon Naturalist) — 3×2 family plate grid
  with per-family event LEDs, global strip with clock swap slot, seed
  ledger, and mix.
- **Preset system** — shared preset-manager module v1.0.5: save / save-as /
  load / load-from-file / prev / next / two-click delete, factory + user
  banks under `~/Library/Ouaricon Bitrot/Presets/`.
- **Factory bank** — 8 presets: Worn Cassette, Skipping Disc, Locked
  Groove, Dropped Call, Cellphone 1998, Eight-Bit Ruin, Total Media
  Failure, Gentle Rot.
