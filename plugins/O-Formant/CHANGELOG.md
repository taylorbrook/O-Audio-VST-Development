# O-Formant Changelog

All notable changes to O-Formant will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-05

### Changed
- **Consonant engine replaced with place/manner articulation model** — Previous LP/HP crossfade + sibilance bandpass produced indistinct continuous noise. New engine uses dual resonant bandpass filters shaped by place-of-articulation (X axis: Labial 500Hz -> Alveolar 3kHz -> Palatal 6kHz -> Velar 2kHz) with manner-dependent temporal profiles (Y axis: Plosive short burst with glottal mute -> Fricative sustained noise). Root cause: old architecture had no spectral place modeling and fixed temporal shape regardless of consonant type.
- **Consonant XY pad replaces Tone/Sibilance knobs** — New interactive 2D pad for place (X) and manner (Y) control with frequency readout, place labels (Lab/Alv/Pal/Vel), and manner labels (Plos/Fric). Matches vowel XY pad visual style.
- **Parameter display names updated** — "Consonant Tone" -> "Place", "Sibilance" -> "Manner" (APVTS IDs unchanged, existing automation compatible)
- **All 16 factory presets updated** — Each preset now has meaningful place/manner values matching its character (e.g., Creature Growl = velar plosive, Robotic Speech = alveolar fricative)
- **Default sibilance (manner) changed from 0.0 to 0.5** — Mid-manner default produces a balanced blend of burst and sustained noise instead of pure plosive

### Technical Notes
- Onset suppression now scales with (1 - manner): full glottal mute for plosives, none for fricatives
- Burst duration varies with manner: 8ms (plosive) to 80ms (fricative)
- Burst decay rate varies with manner: exp(-12t) (plosive, sharp) to exp(-2t) (fricative, gentle)
- Place Q varies: Labial Q=1.5 (broad) -> Alveolar Q=4.0 (tight) -> Palatal Q=3.0 -> Velar Q=2.0
- Preserves v1.0.1 consonant-through-formant routing and onset suppression architecture

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Consonant noise now routed through formant filter bank** — Previously consonant noise bypassed the vocal tract model and was mixed directly into the output, producing raw noise instead of speech-like consonants. Now passes through the same 5-formant parallel BPFs as the glottal source, giving consonants proper vocal tract resonance.
- **Plosive burst sharpened** — Reduced burst duration from 15ms to 8ms with faster exponential decay (exp(-10t) vs exp(-5t)) for more realistic plosive transients.
- **Glottal source suppression during plosive onset** — Added 25ms onset envelope that briefly suppresses the glottal source (70% at peak) during auto-consonant bursts, letting noise dominate at attack before voice takes over. Simulates vocal fold closure during /p/, /t/, /k/ consonants.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **MPE support** - Pressure->breathiness, slide->vowel Y, velocity->attack character
- **Formant shift and spread** - Semitone-based frequency shifting and center-of-mass spacing control
- **Output stage** - Smoothed output gain (dB) and per-voice stereo width (equal-power pan by MIDI note)
