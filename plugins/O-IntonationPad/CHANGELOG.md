# O-IntonationPad Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Real-time complexity fading on held notes**: Changing the complexity knob smoothly fades chord extensions (7th, 9th, 11th, 13th) in/out on already-sounding notes with ~250ms crossfades
- **Real-time voice count fading on held notes**: Changing the voice count knob smoothly fades additional voices in/out on held notes (same 250ms crossfade)
- **Per-voice complexity threshold system**: Triad voices (root, 3rd, 5th) always at full volume; extensions fade based on their complexity tier
- **Gain-aware UI**: Keyboard, frequency list, and pitch circle all reflect per-voice gain with opacity fading — notes fade visually before disappearing

### Changed
- Chord generation always initializes all 12 sub-voices at note-on with full complexity; both voice count and complexity are applied as independent real-time gain multipliers
- Voice distribution assigns intervals sequentially (root, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th...) instead of skipping intervals

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Live note visualization on Voice tab**: Mini piano keyboard (C2-B5, 4 octaves) highlights all active chord tones in real-time as you play
- **Frequency/cent detail list**: Shows each sounding voice's note name, exact frequency (Hz), and cent deviation from 12-TET — making tuning differences visible
- **Pitch circle active note highlighting**: Tuning tab's pitch circle now lights up active pitch classes when notes are playing (uses existing but previously unwired API)
- **C++ to WebView event bridge**: New `emitEventIfBrowserIsVisible("activeNotes")` timer at 30Hz pushes chord data from audio engine to UI

### Technical
- Added `SubVoiceInfo` struct to `WavetableVoice` for storing MIDI note + frequency per sub-oscillator
- Added `getActiveNotes()` API to `PluginProcessor` for collecting active voice data across all synthesiser voices
- `PluginEditor` now inherits from `juce::Timer` for periodic UI updates

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-17

### Initial Release
- Wavetable pad synthesizer with JI-harmonic wavetable (256 frames)
- 1-note chord mode: single MIDI note generates 2-12 voice chords
- 5 tuning systems: 12-TET, Just Intonation, Pythagorean, Historical, Scala
- 10 scale modes with scale-degree chord quality analysis
- 3 randomization axes: inversion, timing, detune
- Global LFO modulating wavetable position
- ADSR envelope, state-variable lowpass filter
- 4-tab WebView UI with Ouaricon Naturalist aesthetic
- Interactive pitch circle visualization on Tuning tab
