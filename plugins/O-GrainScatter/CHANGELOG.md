# Changelog

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-07

### Improved
- Scale, Root Note, and Pitch Mode dropdowns now dim when Pitch Random is at 0%, with hint text "Increase Pitch Rnd to activate" — clarifies that pitch randomization must be active for scale controls to have effect

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- Granular scatter engine with 64-voice polyphonic grain pool
- Delay buffer with Lagrange 3rd-order interpolation for smooth pitched reads
- Free mode: density-controlled grain spawning (10ms to 1000ms intervals)
- Beat sync mode: 6 subdivision options (1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/8T, 1/16T)
- Euclidean rhythm patterns for gating grain triggers (2-16 steps, 1-16 pulses)
- Repeat burst system (1-16 repeats per trigger) with stutter gate
- Freeze: capture and loop audio with 5ms crossfade on engage and release
- 5 musical scales: Chromatic, Major, Minor, Pentatonic, Whole Tone
- 4 pitch modes: Random, Ladder Up, Ladder Down, Pendulum
- Scale quantizer with root note selection (C through B)
- Spread control for grain position scatter
- Pan randomization with equal-power panning law
- Reverse grain probability
- Feedback with soft-clipping (tanh) to prevent runaway
- Smoothed dry/wet mix crossfade
- Output soft-clipping to prevent digital clipping with many overlapping grains
- Standalone tempo tracker with 120 BPM fallback and DAW loop detection
- WebView UI with vintage Naturalist aesthetic (Garamond serif, parchment palette)
- Real-time grain scatter visualization (Canvas 2D, position vs pitch)
- Euclidean circle visualizer with polygon overlay and step indicator
- Freeze glow animation on toggle button
- Double-click knob reset to default values
- 18 automatable parameters across 4 groups (Core, Sync, Spread, Euclidean)
- Cross-platform WebView2 support with static linking for Windows
- State save/restore via XML serialization
