# O-Bells Changelog

All notable changes to O-Bells will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **Output clipping at default settings** - Added proper gain staging normalization in DSP
  - Root cause: 8 partials summing to ~2.7x, plus unison voices and octave layers, caused signal to exceed 0 dBFS
  - Fix: Normalize signal for partial count (0.4x), unison voices (sqrt), and octave layer blend before output gain stage
  - Output gain at 0 dB now produces unity gain as expected

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **Reverb control** - New "Reverb" slider in the Output section for adding spaciousness to bell sounds
  - Range: 0-100% wet/dry mix
